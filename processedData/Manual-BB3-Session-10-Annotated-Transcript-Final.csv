2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,X,"Hi, Abe. How are you doing?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Hi. Pretty good.,"Oh, I'm so pleased to hear that. Can I just take a quick look?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Sure.,"[looking at the scales Abe filled out] Oh, yes. This does look like you're feeling better. [pause] Great. How about if we do an update?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,"So, what was good about the past week?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, some of the things that I've doing and working on are still going well. So, like still being in contact with the family. I contacted Charlie. Well, when I saw Charlie, I asked him if I could have some more hours and he said yes. So that made me feel good for a bunch of reasons.","Oh, good."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I called John and he seemed happy to hear from me, so that was good.","You know, a couple weeks ago you were even afraid to ask Charlie for any hours at all. Remember that? Because you made a negative prediction about it."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Because of the way that my last job ended I was afraid that nobody would give me any hours, or hire me, or want me at all.","And then Charlie did, so I guess that prediction turned out to be wrong. And then sounds to me as if you did well enough that Charlie is willing to give you a few more hours?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"He did give me a few more hours and so far, that's going okay.",Great. Do you feel like you've done a reasonable job working for Charlie?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Oh, yeah. It's mostly labor, so it isn't hard mentally, it's just hard physically. But, yeah, I'm doing it and I show up on time and things are going well.","So, what was good this week about working for Charlie? What did that mean, the fact that you'd done this?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, the fact that I can get there on time, that I can do a good job. I think it builds my confidence a little bit just being back to work. Because I was really worried after the last job because of the way that ended, whether or not...",Something bad might happen this time?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"Yeah. It doesn't sound like it has, is that right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. No, not yet.",Did it feel good to be productive?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Oh, yeah. Yeah.",And it sounds like you were on time so you were reliable?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Mm-hmm [nods “yes”],You did a good job in what you were doing?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"In fact, such a good job that he's willing to give you some more hours."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. Well, it's summertime construction, he's got a lot of work. And so, the fact that I wanted some hours he seemed happy that I wanted them.","That's great. And you reconnected with John because you'd also made some negative predictions about that, I think."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. Yeah. So, I talked to him and he seemed happy to hear from me.",What do you make of that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't know. I guess things are okay with him and I was worried that because I hadn't called him or been in contact with him for a long time, I was afraid he'd just sort of written me off.","Uh-huh [nods “yes”]. As we talked about last week, of course, he hadn't called you either."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,So it sounds like the two of you just let each other slip a little bit.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I guess that's right.","And now you're back. What would have happened if you had really bought into this automatic though, ""He's not going to want to hear from me""?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'll probably wouldn't have called him.,"No, I don't think you would have.  So, it's so good that you called him, right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"Yeah. And it was taking a little bit of a risk there, right, because you really thought that he might not take too kindly to your call?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,So you put yourself out there. That's good. Is this another example of how you took control?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. Because, well, like you said, I wouldn't have.","Yeah. That's good. So, did anything else happen this week that I should know about?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No, not that I can think of right now.","So, let's set our agenda, what's the goal for today's session? Did you write something down about that?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, since I've been writing lots of stuff down... My daughter's having a barbecue and her in-laws are coming and are going to be there.",I see.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,And I'm worried about what they're going to think about me because of everything that's happened to me.,So is your goal to reduce your worry about seeing her in-laws? Or is it a different goal?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, it's reducing the worry, but I don't know what to say to them.","Oh, okay. So it's both?  I think we can figure out what to say, and if we do that, then that should reduce the worry. Is that right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, probably if I knew... I mean, I just don't even have any idea what to say to them.",I have some ideas. I think this is a pretty easy one.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,But an important one. Any other goals for this session?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,"If you think of anything, let me know."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No, that's the main thing.",Okay. Can we take a look at your Action Plan?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,My Action Plan? Okay. Okay.,Do you want to start reading the Action Plan to me?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,If I think that I should be all better by now…,"Because that was the thought that you had had last week, right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, yeah. My thought was I shouldn't have been that bad in the first place.","First place, right. That's true."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I remind myself that I am somewhat better.,That's true.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I am somewhat better and I did that.,You are.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I straightened up my apartment.,"That took quite a while, didn't it?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,And you got it done.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. That reminds me of another thing if we have time.,What's that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I was straightening up my apartment and I put some stuff out in the hallway, and one of my neighbors was upset that I put it there instead of taking it all the way down to the dumpster.","So, the goal of this would be what? To talk to your neighbor, to feel better about the situation?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No, I guess that I can tell you about that, but I don't think we need to spend time on that.","Okay. All right, so back to the Action Plan. So, you said you straightened up your apartment..."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I've worked a couple times in construction, okay? I've done that and that's gone well. I'm doing more with the kids and the family, been doing that.",Good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I've reconnected with, well, I was already connected with Charlie, but got more with him and reconnected with John.",Right.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'm doing as well as could be expected for someone who was severely depressed in May.,What do you think about that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't know what the expectation would be, but I think I'm doing as well as I can.",Good. That's good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'm doing all the right things. I don't know. The things we talk about here I've tried to do.,Excellent.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,But it's still going to take longer until I'm feeling normal again.,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Exactly. Do you think it was helpful to read this, or it really just didn't make much of a difference?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Oh, I think it was helpful during the week. Right now, it just sort of seems like it all came and worked out the way it was supposed to.",Excellent.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"So, I think it's okay.",What else was on your Action Plan?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Talk to Charlie, I did that.",Good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Keep looking for customer service jobs.,Were you able to do that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I did, but that's hard because you're filling out things online and you're not talking to somebody. And I don't really... They ask you for what you have been doing and I don't know how to explain what I've been doing for the past two years.","So, is that something for our agenda?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, probably.","We have the barbecue at your daughter's, and you'll see her in-laws."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Her in-laws, yeah.",And then filling out the job applications and what to say about not working.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"And, let's see, were you able to keep giving yourself credit?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I'm doing that.",That's good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Pretty good.,And did you do a Testing Your Thoughts worksheet?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I did. That was what I started to tell you. That was when I was cleaning my apartment and I put some of the stuff out in the hallway just until I had it all ready to go at the same time. And my neighbor complained to me. And initially when he started complaining, I thought that I was doing something wrong or should've done it differently, or whatever. But then I went through this and I sort of came to the conclusion, ""No, I had a pretty good plan.""",Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I was getting the stuff from the apartment to the hallway, and then it was all going to go from the hallway out to the trash bin. And it was in the middle of the day, it wasn't bothering anybody out there.",Is this that neighbor who’s so picky?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"Yeah. Sounds that way. But how great that you didn't let what he said affect you too strongly, is that right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. Well, initially it did, but then I still got this and it reminded me I used this and thought, ""Well, let me think this through."" And since I had the form, I just went through it and did it.","So, let's see, what from the Action Plan might you want to continue this coming week? I'm not sure you need to keep on reading this thing about, ""I should be better by now."" Sounds like that's pretty much in your head?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'm doing better. I'm doing better and I believe that.,Yeah. So you already asked Charlie...
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Talked to Charlie.,We're going to talk about the job applications. You're going to still keep the credit list?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I'd better. I'd better.",And keep on doing some worksheets?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,When you need to.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, because there's still, I still have weak moments.","Good. All right. So, we have the barbecue and we have the job applications. Is there anything that's even more important than these two things?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,"So, which would you like to... Do you want to make sure we get to both of them, or if there's only time for one, how would you like to spend the time?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Let's do the job applications because the barbecue is still a couple weeks away.,"A couple weeks away? Oh, okay. So if we don't get to it, it'll be all right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"If we don't get to that today, that'd be all right. But the job applications, that's bothering me every day.","Good. Let's talk about that then. It sounds like you were able to identify at least a couple of jobs, but then you got kind of daunted when you saw the application?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, when it asked for prior employment and they ask you sort of do things by date. And then I've got this big hole, the past two years.",Right.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"What do I put in there, you know? Dropped off the end of the earth? I mean, I don't know what to put in there.",And are there any other hard parts about the application? Or is that really the one that's bothering you the most?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I have to explain why I left the last job, but, I mean, I know what to say there. I don't know what they're going to think about it, but I know how to explain it.",Right. So you don't need my help with that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,No. So let's talk about how you could fill in the application. Can I ask you some questions about this?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Sure.,"If I remember right, when you first lost your job, you looked around a little while for new jobs and didn't find anything. And then weren't you helping out Charlie back then?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, a little bit.",So you had a few days of helping with construction then?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,And you've had a few days recently?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,I wonder whether you could put down that you've been working in construction?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I can.,Do you think Charlie would give you a good reference?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I think he would, but I haven't done a lot of work for Charlie. That's the only thing.","Well, do you have to put on the application how much work you've done?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Well...,"I suppose it could come up in a job interview, but how about just on the application?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'd be afraid to say that I'd been working the whole time for Charlie.,Uh-huh [nods “yes”].
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, because I haven't, and Charlie will tell them that.",Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, that I... So, I don't, I mean, I can tell them that, but I think I need to tell them more.",Okay.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't know, maybe?",Is there even room on the application to explain like that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know.,"One of the things that you could do is that you could just put down the date for two years ago, and the date of this year, and have one year with nothing. Unless you think that actually did work in that intervening year, you could put that one in, too. So, and if you put them down with commas, I think what that usually means to people is that it wasn't continuous or you would've said this year to that year."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I think I could also put on there that I've done some volunteer work.,"Oh, yeah. That's good, too."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,So that it won't look like I just sat around the whole time.,That you just weren't doing anything. Right. So you're going to put down the work at the homeless shelter?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"The homeless shelter, yeah.","Yeah, that's good."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"And I've done a couple special project things. Well, this was before, well, with the church. I don't know if I can use that or not, but... Well, I can just say I did volunteer work and use the homeless shelter as a place.",Right. And you could also say you did do some work at the church?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,You think that's been in the last two and a half years?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I kind of dropped off church around that same time.,"Oh, okay. So just leave it off then. How does that sound?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. I can say that I've done construction when it was available. I've done some work in the homeless shelter.,Good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I can say that.,"Now, when you get an interview, do you think that the company that you're going to apply to has hired other people in the last couple years?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, probably.","Might be an expanding company, might not be, right? But I'm just wondering whether the job interviewer knows that it's more difficult for people to get jobs when they're in their 50's, than when they're in their 20's, and 30's, and 40's?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,They probably know it because they're the ones not hiring us.,"Exactly, right. And so I wonder whether, in your interview, you might be able to say honestly that you've been looking for a job, but that it's been difficult?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"I don't think there's a place for that on the job application, but I thought maybe it'd be good for you start thinking about that."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, the other thing about it is that my last, except for the last few months when I was there, I was working as a supervisor and then it makes it hard to go in to a new place and get a job as a supervisor. Nobody wants to hire... they want to hire you at entry level positions. And so, you can't just go over there and... But, if I could get a job in customer service, I mean, even if I had to start at the bottom, I think I'd be okay with that.","That's good. And do you have something good in mind that you can say if the interviewer says, ""But you were a supervisor before and this is an entry level job."" What would you say back?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, but this in the area where I like to work and so I'm willing to take an entry level job. The problem that I had at my last job is that they moved me from customer service over to inventory, and I didn't know how to do that. I mean, there were computers and there were spreadsheets and stuff, and I didn't grow up with that stuff. I didn't know how to do that. So, as long as I was working at customer service, I was doing good. It's when they moved me to inventory that I had a problem.","Yeah. Oh, I think that's a great answer if an interviewer says, ""What happened with the last job?"""
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,What could get in the way of filling out the job application now?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I mean, just that I would have the thought that even if I put down construction and volunteer work, that that won't be enough. But, I mean, I think that that's the best plan I have right now, so I'll just put it down. I mean, I can't get any worse results than what I've already gotten.","Yeah. Do you need to write down, ""If I think that they won't like my lack of work history, remind myself, ‘This is the best plan I have’ ""?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,Great. Anything else on job applications?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No. I don't think so.,Can I just ask you one more question?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,What does it say about you as a person that you're willing to go into an entry level job?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,People need to work.,So it shows you-
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, I think that work is important. I think that earning money is important.",So you have a good work ethic? Some people would feel themselves too superior to take an entry level job. It doesn't sound like you have that sense about yourself?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I would just be happy to be working again.,"Yeah. So I think-- does that show that you're humble? That you have good values, that you would put productivity over superiority?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know if it means that or not but sounds good.,"Okay. Anything else on this, or should we talk about the barbecue?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Talk about the barbecue.,Okay. So it's in a couple of weeks?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,And do you have a picture in your mind about what the barbecue is going to be like?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. I imagine I'm going to go there and then my wife and her family are sort of going to be talking and stuff.,Your ex-wife?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No, no.","No, no. Your daughter?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"My daughter, I'm sorry.","Oh, your daughter and her family?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"That my daughter and her family are going to be there and talking, and everything. And then I just sort of imagine that her in-laws are going to be sort of over on the side just talking among themselves.",Okay.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"And that's going to be awkward and difficult to break into. And I'm going to walk in, my daughter will be happy to see me, and my son-in-law, too, but-",What do you think is going to be the most difficult moment for you?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I think after I say hello to my daughter and her husband, and my grandkids, there's going to be a time when everybody recognizes that I've said hello to everybody, but I haven't done any talking with her in-laws. And I think that that's going to be a difficult moment.",Uh-huh [nods “yes”].
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I probably saw them one or two times, but not regularly. It's not like we were ever friends. I mean, part of that was when I was married before we'd only do things with other people together.",Right.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"So, I never really saw them or really got to know them that much.","And when you did have a little bit of time with them, what was your impression of them?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"They're perfectly nice people. They were okay. They seemed friendly. That was when I was working and when I felt normal. And now I haven't been for such a long time, I don't know what they're going to think about.",Mm-hmm [nods “yes”].
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"They're going to think that I'm just lazy, irresponsible.",Do you have a picture in your head of them believing this about you?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. Like I'm sitting there, once we get to that moment after I've said hello to everybody, then I sort of look over at them and they look back at me. And they have just this look on their face of disapproval.",Mm-hmm [nods “yes”]. And do you have any evidence? Is there something that makes you think that they'll be critical of you? Or do you have any evidence that makes you think that they won't be critical of you? Or do you really just not know?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know. I just assume that everybody thinks that about me.,"Well, is that what John thought about you when you reconnected with him?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,Is that what Charlie thought?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,Is it what your kids have thought all along?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,"No. So, is it what I think of you?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No, but that's your job.","Well, it is my job to try to look at things realistically. Now, I don't know how to look realistically about your daughter's in-laws. I don't know whether they're going to be critical or not. The question is, is it worth it to you to act as if you feel confident? And is it worth it to you to go up to them and if they ask, ""What have you been doing lately?"" you could say you've been working construction. You could say you're looking for, you'd like to get back into customer service, so you've been applying for jobs in that."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"So, if you were to say that in kind of an upbeat way, what are the chances, do you think, that they'll be really critical of you?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Not to my face, anyway.","Yeah. And after you say that, if you want, you can just very quickly change the subject. Would you like to do a little role play on this? Do you want to be you or you want me to be you?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Sure. I should be me.,And who am I? The wife or the husband? Who's easier to talk to?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,That's what I'm trying to... Probably the husband is easier for me to talk to because we can talk about sports and stuff.,"Oh, that's good. What's his name?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,It's a funny name. It's Elias.,Elias? Okay.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"All right. I'm Elias, and do I come up to you or do you come up to me?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I mean, that's the question. So, I've said hello, I look over, I see them sort of looking. They're settled, so I guess I have to go over to you.","Okay. And remember now what I want you to do is to act as if you have confidence. Act as if you feel good about the fact that you're doing construction, that you're looking for another job. Act as if you expect them to be nice to you. So, if you have that attitude, what does your face look like?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,[smiles],"Like that, right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"That smile, right? Kind of open, the smile. What does your posture look like? You're feeling confident about yourself."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I guess I'd have to probably sit up straight. Or stand up straight. I'd stand up and go over and...,"So, you're coming to me, I'm Elias, so you're standing up straight, you're smiling, you come over to me and you say...?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Hi, Elias, how you doing?",Pretty good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Good. It's good to see you.,Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Haven't seen you for a long time.,"Nice to see you, too. You know I'm retired now and I have to tell you, I'm enjoying retirement. How about you?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I'm still in the game a little bit. I've been doing a little bit of construction and I'd like to get back into customer service if I could, so I've been looking at jobs with that.","That's good. And I know you know even though the economy is booming, it seems hard for people our age to get jobs."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"It's hard, yeah. People don't seem to want to talk to me.",Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"So, anyway.","Oh, that's unfortunate."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Well...,"Okay, how about if you change the subject now?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,What do you think about the Phillies [baseball team] this year?,"I'm so disappointed. I have to tell you. After last season, I really thought they had a chance, but I don't know. They're not doing too well."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, they've got some expensive players and I thought they'd do better, but...","So, you going to any games?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I haven't. I haven't yet. I'd like to some time, but I'd like to wait to see them do better, too.","Yeah. I went to see a couple games early on, that's when they were doing well, but I haven't gone for a while either."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah. So, I don't know. Things don't look good for them right now. I don't know, maybe the Eagles [football team] have a better chance this year.","Yeah, I hope so. I don't have to tell you I'm much more of a baseball fan, though, than a football fan."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"Okay. Let's come out of role play. First of all, I thought everything you said was great. Second of all, you looked pretty depressed when you were telling me all this stuff. I'm wondering if we could just try it once more and have you try to feel confident? Let me ask you a couple questions. One of the things that you read about here was that you really have made a fair amount of progress. And that you are right where you should be, given how depressed you were last May. So, you are right on the road where you should be right now, Abe."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"The second thing is, look at how much more you're doing these days than you did before. And the fact that you're working construction and that you got extra days, boy, that to me shows you're really willing to work hard to get over this depression."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,"And the fact that you were able to fill out the Testing Your Thoughts worksheet, and that it worked, and it helped you feel better. The fact that you've gotten your apartment really straightened out. All those things are really great."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. Okay.,"Now, let me ask you another question. Does Elias know that you've been depressed?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know.,Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know what he knows. I don't know what they've told them.,"Right. But what do you think of trying to do this one more time, but with smiles?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,All right. I'll try it.,"Okay. So I think the attitude you have to have is that you're actually really glad to see Elias.  You connected with him a little bit in the past, here's an opportunity to connect with him more strongly. What would be good if you did connect with him more strongly?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, we might do things more together as a family.",That's right.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"That would be, I mean, just make us all closer.","Uh-huh  [nods “yes”].  Would it mean something to your daughter, do you think, if you got closer to her in-laws?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Probably she'd like that.,"I bet she would like that. Yeah. So, is it worth it to really try to put yourself out there and be smiling?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,"It's hard, though, right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"All right. So, you're going to get triple credit if you can do this. Okay, so here I am, I'm Elias, I'm sitting here with my wife."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"All right. So, you're going to get triple credit if you can do this. Okay, so here I am, I'm Elias, I'm sitting here with my wife.",Pretty good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I haven't seen you for a long time. How have you been doing?,"Oh, pretty well. I'm retired now."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Are you?,Yep. Putter a lot around the house and stuff.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I'm still trying. I've been doing a little bit of construction, and I'm actually trying to get back into customer service again because I really liked it when I used to do that, and I haven't done that. So, I've been putting in some applications and doing that. In the meantime, I've been doing a little bit of construction work, and volunteering, and things like that.","Oh, good for you."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"So, that's... we'll see. We'll see how it all works out. But, anyway, what do you think about the Phillies this year?","I'm so disappointed. I had high hopes after last season, but they're not really doing very well."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,I don't know. What do you think?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, they've spent a lot of money on big-buck players who aren't paying off is mostly what it is. So, I don't know. I'd like to go to a game some time, but I don't want to spend the money on a game if they're just going to be as bad as they've been doing.",Yeah. I don't blame you.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't know, maybe the Eagles will be better this year.","Oh, I think that's wishful thinking, Abe. After last season?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, well. Well, maybe the quarterback thing straightened out at this point.","Yeah, I hope so. All right. Let's come out of the role play. You did great. That was such a difference between the first one and the second one. "
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,It was hard.,And it was hard-
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't feel like I did that much better, but-","Oh, boy, I have to tell you, just looking at your face, your voice was louder. I don't know if you know."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, it was louder.","Right? You sounded as if you weren't afraid of what he was going to think. You sounded, you know, and you were just kind of matter-of-fact talking about construction and applying for new jobs. You weren't negative about it in any way. But you did a really good job. Do you have any other topics that you might talk to him with, about?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, sports.",Sports?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, we can always talk about the grandchildren.","Yeah, that's a good one."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"That's always easy to talk about. And maybe even talk about going to some of their activities together, maybe.","Oh, right. You might see them."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Or see them there.,Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know how much he goes to.,Any other topics?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, our kids, of course, and what they're doing, and how they're getting along, which is good. They're doing really good.","Do they have other children, too?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, they do. I think they have. I think two other daughters.","So, you could always ask about them?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"You know what topic I find most people like to talk about is travel. So, have they been any place in the last couple of years? Or, are they planning to go someplace, or what's on their bucket list?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. I have trouble talking about that because I haven't gone anywhere or done anything.,"So, if Elias were to say, ""Oh, yeah, we're going to Mexico in a couple of months,"" what could you say back to that?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"“Where are you going to go? What are you going to do?” No, that would be okay if he would say that.","That's great. And what's on your bucket list, Abe? Where would you like to go?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I guess the thing is that travel hasn't been the thing that's been most important to me. It's just sort of I'm happy to stay close to home and be close with my family. I don't really think about going other places much. ,"So, if he asks you, you can say that. You've never really had the travel bug."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"Yeah. Good. All right. So, what did we talk about in terms of Elias that you'd like to remember?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Well, I think probably he'll be okay. I mean, he's certainly okay.",Want to write some of this down?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Elias will probably be happy to see me.,Mm-hmm  [nods “yes”].
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,And we have common interests to talk about.,That's true.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Sports, kids, grandchildren.","You could ask how he's spending his time in retirement. Now, you want to say anything [in your therapy notes] about your appearance?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I don't know what you mean.,"How your face might look, what your posture might look like?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Oh. I want to stand up straight, smile, talk loud enough.",Talk with enthusiasm? I think it's easier to do when you're talking about your grandchildren.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah. Yeah.,That's good.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Much easier than the Phillies.,And why is it worth it to do this? What will it mean if you do this?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I mean, well, I mean it just ties into everything else that we've been talking about. And everything I've been doing. It's going to help me to just kind of be normal, and have a normal life again","Exactly. Do you want to write that down, or do you think that's really in your head now?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'll write it down.,And let's go back to the job application. What do you want to write down about that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,That since my last job I want to be able to say that I haven't just been sitting around doing nothing.,"Right. So, when it says, ""List what you're doing,"" what can you list?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I've been doing some stuff on construction, been volunteering, and I think the way that I would say that, I just want to get back to customer service because I was happy doing that.","The application, do they give you any space to just say why you want the job, or talk about yourself?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I think it's--different ones are different. Usually, at the end they have a space where you can write something if you want to.","So, this would be a great thing to write."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Get back to customer service.,"That you really like to do that, you really enjoyed it when you were doing it, you did it so well you got made supervisor. But you're willing to do an entry level job."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'd do anything just because it's just important to me to work.,"Yeah. That might be good for you to put in the application, too, then if there's a space. You know what, something that just occurred to me, is that Charlie was a... No, not Charlie. Sorry. Joseph was the boss who switched you to inventory, right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"But he was new in the job, as I remember, right? Who was your supervisor, or boss, before Joseph?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,That was Dan.,Dan. And do you think Dan would give you a good recommendation?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,"So, there may be a place on the application to say ""references,"" maybe you want to give Dan's name and number? Might be good to call Dan, or email him or something, beforehand so he'll know to expect a call. Would you have any problem doing that?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Some, but I think I can.","You can get yourself to do it? That's great. So we're giving you some hard things to do. And I think the application won't be nearly as hard now that we've figured out what you could say. Might be pretty hard to talk to Elias, might be pretty hard to call Dan. Right?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,You think you have the strength to be able to do this?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I'll try.,I think you do. I think you do. I think it was pretty impressive how you were able to turn your mood around about your picky neighbor. I think it's been pretty impressive how much time you've been spending with your family.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Picky neighbor was easier for me to figure out, I think.",Yeah.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Because he irritates me.,"And the fact that you're working in construction, you're just doing so many good things now, Abe. Is there any last thing you want to talk about? You got your Action Plan firmly in your mind?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"No. I think, I mean, this is helpful.",Good. Any problems you think doing this?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"I don't know. I'll find out, but I'm going to do it. I mean, these are the kinds of things that, even though overall I've been doing better, these are the things that I've been stumbling on.","Yeah. And I don't think we could have worked on these things, to be honest with you, back in May."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No.,"The fact that we're even working on them now, I think, is really a testament to you of how hard you've worked, to be able to get to this point, even where you could even think about doing these things."
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Yeah.,You think I'm right about that?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Yeah, I couldn't have talked about these in May.",Yeah. And you're going to continue to give yourself credit because that's our standing thing and continue to do worksheet.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,I find it useful to just keep the rubber band handy-,"You know what I think this rubber band is? I think it's a ""taking control"" rubber band. Good. Any feedback about the session?"
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,No. It was good. This was really helpful.,Great. All right. Can I take my copy of the Action Plan then?
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,"Oh, yeah.",All right. Same time next week.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,Great. See you then.
2,Generalized Anxiety Disorder,45-54,Okay.,X
